6. Video Background Site
This project explains with full source code, how we can add a video background to a web page. The foreground contains some text. The project uses HTML5. The speaker also tells a simple trick to avoid scrollbars. You will also learn to add text at the forefront and style it to appear in the centre of the page. If you resize the page, the video resizes and comes as per the screen size by setting simple CSS values. Videos in the background can give a lovely effect to your website and make it interactive. View the video background animation for the code and explanations.



7. Create an Image Slider 
Image slider or slide show is a prevalent functionality that most websites show today. In any site, for example, fashion, food, services, etc., you can observe that most of the content is shown through multiple images. If you know how to display images as a slideshow, the other content can be developed by using plain input and other data types. The entire project has been done using only HTML and CSS, and no JavaScript, thus avoiding any cross-browser issues. The speaker explains the functionality in detail here. 





8. Interactive Restaurant Website
In this project, we will create an interactive homepage of a restaurant, where the background image will change when we hover over a menu option. For example, if you hover over menu navigation, it will display a menu card, if you hover over the home, it will show the default. You have to give your image names and locations for this to work. This functionality is done through jQuery. Same way, the ‘order now’ button will keep flashing. We have done this by using @keyframes functionality which we have used in our animated website project too. Here is the code for this: 

<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body{
   font-size:20px;
            color: white;
            background-size: cover;
        }
         .box{ width: 900px;
       float:right;
       border:1px solid none;}
       .box ul li{
           width: 120px;
           float:left;
           margin: 10px auto;
           text-align: center;
       }
 .mainmenu
.mainmenu a
.mainmenu a:hover
.mainmenu img{
position: fixed;
z-index: -1;
top:0px; left:0px; width:100%; height: 100vh;
opacity: 0.9;
/*object-fit:cover;*/
transition: all ease 0.5s;
}
   .wd{
           width: 300px;
           height: 539px;
           background-color: black;
           opacity: 0.8;
           padding: 55px;
       }
       .wd h1{
           text-align: center;
           text-transform: uppercase;
           font-weight: 300px;
       }
       .wd h4{
           text-align: justify;
           color:darkgray;
           font-weight: 100px;
       }
       .wd h2{
           text-align: center;
           text-transform: uppercase;
           font-weight: normal;
           margin: 40px auto;
       }
       .opt form , input[type="button"]{
           background-color: black;
           color:white;
         /* padding:10px;*/
           margin:-14px auto;
           padding-left: 50px;
           padding-right: 50px;
           text-align: center;
           font-size: 16px;
       }
     form, input[type="button"] {
       animation: glowing 300ms infinite;
       font-weight: 500%;
      }
      @keyframes glowing {
 0% {
   background-color: red;
 }
 50% {
   background-color: orange;
 }
 100% {
   background-color: blue;
 }
}
   </style>
</head>
<body>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(function(){
var image = $(".mainmenu").find('img').attr('src');
$(".mainmenu a").mouseover(function(){
var newimg = $(this).attr('data-image');
$(this).parent().find('img').attr("src", newimg);
});
});
</script>
   <div class="box">
<div class="mainmenu">
<img src="food.png">
<a data-image = "food.png" href=""> Home</a>
<a data-image = "menucard.jpg" href=""> Menu</a>
<a href=""> FAQ</a>
<a href=""> Contact</a>
</div>
   </div>
   <div class="wd">
<h1> Welcome to xxx</h1>
<h4> <i>Order delicious food online, 100% quality, safety and taste assured.</i></h4>
<h2> Call 999999999 for reservations</h2>
<div class="opt">
<form action="" method="post">
<input type="button" value="ORDER NOW">
</form>
</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
The output will be: 

Interactive restaurant website

Upon hovering on the menu navigation, the page will look like:

10. Grid Responsive Website Layout
This is a single-page website page that includes multiple HTML and CSS components. A little complex project, but at the end of it, you should be able to create a page with a CSS grid on your own. The speaker uses simple HTML and CSS elements with good explanations. Whatever you have learned in other projects, you will be able to apply all that and more in this project. The project also includes how to make the page mobile-friendly. The page uses some new techniques like flex and media queries as well. Check out the video:
